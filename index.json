Part I of the study examined large-scale atmospheric contributions to the atmospheric river-influenced events and subsequent societal impacts. Contrary to expectations based on previous work in this region, the event having a lower event accumulation and shorter duration resulted in a greater number of triggered landslides and prolonged downstream flooding outside of the mountains. One purpose of this study (Part II) is to examine the local atmospheric conditions contributing to the rather unusual surface response to the shorter duration heavy rainfall event of 12‚Äì13 April 2020. A second purpose of this study is to investigate the utility of several spaced-based QPE and vertical atmospheric profile methods in illuminating some of the atmospheric conditions unique to the April event. The embedded mesoscale convective elements in the warm sector of the April event were larger and of longer duration than of the other event in February 2020, leading to sustained periods of convective rain rates. The environment of the April event was convectively unstable, and the resulting available potential energy was sustained by relatively dry airstreams at the 700 hPa level, continuously overriding the moist air stream at low levels attributed to an atmospheric river.","tags":null,"title":"Study of Two Impactful Heavy Rainfall Events in the Southern Appalachian Mountains during Early 2020, Part II; Regional Overview, Rainfall Evolution, and Satellite QPE Utility","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Malarvizhi Arulraj","Ana P.

Satellite-based radar observations at high resolution have the best potential to capture the spatial patterns of precipitation, but there is high uncertainty in the interpretation of low-level measurements due to ground clutter effects, observing geometry, and sub-grid scale vertical and horizontal heterogeneity of precipitation systems that result from interactions among orographic clouds and propagating storm systems. In the high elevation tropics and in middle mountains everywhere, the landscape is often immersed in multi-layered cloud systems that modify precipitation significantly at low levels in a complex manner depending on time of day and location very different from the classical understanding of orographic precipitation enhancement with elevation, and are not easily parameterized or corrected for in QPE algorithms. Here, a review of challenges to remote sensing of orographic precipitation with a focus on the physical-basis of rainfall estimation errors is presented using radar measurements and precipitation products from the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) and Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) satellites, ground-validation (GV) data in the Andes, the Himalayas, and the Southern Appalachian Mountains, and model simulations. Emphasis is placed on spatial and temporal variability of rainfall and associated cloud systems with a focus on water cycle research and hydrological applications in the tropics and in the mid-latitudes.","tags":null,"title":"Remote Sensing of Orographic Precipitation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Wowchemy is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

The results explain the propagation of multiscale climate variability into the regional groundwater system through recharge modulated by topography, geomorphology, and geology to determine the spatial organization of baseflow variability at decadal (and longer) time-scales, that is, deep hydrologic drought. Further, these findings suggest potential for long-range predictability of hydrological drought in small and mid-size watersheds, where baseflow is a robust indicator of nonstationary yield capacity of the underlying groundwater basins. Predictive associations between climate mode indices and deep baseflow (e.g. persistent decreases of the decadal-scale components of baseflow during the cold phase of the AMO in the USSA) can be instrumental toward improving forecast lead-times and long-range mitigation of severe drought.","tags":null,"title":"Decadal Climate Variability and the Spatial Organization of Deep Hydrological Drought","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Malarvizhi Arulraj","Ana P.

To address this problem, a new algorithm to detect and classify shallow rainfall based on space‚Äìtime dual-frequency correlation (DFC) of concurrent W- and Ka-band radar reflectivity profiles is demonstrated using ground-based observations from the Integrated Precipitation and Hydrology Experiment (IPHEx) in the Appalachian Mountains (MV), United States, and the Biogenic Aerosols‚ÄìEffects on Clouds and Climate (BAECC) in Hyytiala (TMP), Finland. Detection is successful with false alarm errors of 2.64% and 4.45% for MV and TMP, respectively, corresponding to one order of magnitude improvement over the skill of operational satellite-based radar algorithms in similar conditions. Shallow rainfall is misclassified 12.5% of the time at MV, but all instances of low-level reverse orographic enhancement are detected and classified correctly. The classification errors are 8% and 17% for deep and shallow rainfall, respectively, in TMP; the latter is linked to reflectivity profiles with dark band but insufficient radar sensitivity to light rainfall ( mm h‚àí1) remains the major source of error. The potential utility of the algorithm for satellite-based observations in mountainous regions is explored using an observing system simulation (OSS) of concurrent CloudSat Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) and GPM Dual-Frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) during IPHEx, and concurrent satellite observations over Borneo. The results suggest that integration of the methodology in existing regime-based classification algorithms is straightforward, and can lead to significant improvements in the detection and identification of shallow precipitation.","tags":null,"title":"Shallow Precipitation Detection and Classification using Multifrequency Radar Observations and Model Simulations","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
