abstract: Two heavy rainfall events occurring in early 2020 brought flooding, flash flooding, strong winds, and tornadoes to the southern Appalachian Mountains. Part I of the study examined large-scale atmospheric contributions to the atmospheric river-influenced events and subsequent societal impacts. Contrary to expectations based on previous work in this region, the event having a lower event accumulation and shorter duration resulted in a greater number of triggered landslides and prolonged downstream flooding outside of the mountains. One purpose of this study (Part II) is to examine the local atmospheric conditions contributing to the rather unusual surface response to the shorter duration heavy rainfall event of 12â€“13 April 2020. A second purpose of this study is to investigate the utility of several spaced-based QPE and vertical atmospheric profile methods in illuminating some of the atmospheric conditions unique to the April event. The embedded mesoscale convective elements in the warm sector of the April event were larger and of longer duration than of the other event in February 2020, leading to sustained periods of convective rain rates. The environment of the April event was convectively unstable, and the resulting available potential energy was sustained by relatively dry airstreams at the 700 hPa level, continuously overriding the moist air stream at low levels attributed to an atmospheric river.
